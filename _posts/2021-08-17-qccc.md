### Overview
The past five years have seen tremendous development in quantum computing technology, remarked by the demonstration of quantum supremacy. Although many quantum algorithms declare exponential speedups over their classical counterparts, today's quantum devices in the noisy-intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era are very susceptible to environmental noise, internal interference, manufacturing imperfection, and technology limitation. Consequently, quantum algorithms that are more robust to noise, or can be effectively decomposed into small pieces for incremental or parallel quantum execution become promising.  

The purpose of this workshop is to explore innovative ways of quantum-classical cooperative computing (QCCC) to make quantum computing more effective and scalable in NISQ platforms. The workshop will focus heavily on how classical computing can improve NISQ device execution efficiency, scalability, or compensate for noise impact or technology deficiency, with particular emphasis on demonstrable approaches on existing NISQ platforms, such as IBM-Q, IonQ and Rigetti.

## Topics

Topics of interest for this workshop include, but not limited to:
* Quantum classical hybrid algorithms
* Variational quantum algorithms (VQA)
* Quantum runtime systems and schedulers
* Parallel quantum computing
* Quantum resources management
* Architectural support for QCCC
* Quantum circuit decomposition, integration and sampling techniques

### Overview

<!-- Abstract -->
The past five years have seen tremendous development in quantum computing technology, remarked by the demonstration of quantum supremacy. Although many quantum algorithms declare exponential speedups over their classical counterparts, todayâ€™s quantum devices in the noisy-intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era are very susceptible to environmental noise, internal interference, manufacturing imperfection, and technology limitation. Consequently, quantum algorithms that are more robust to noise, or can be effectively decomposed into small pieces for incremental or parallel quantum execution become promising.

<!-- objective -->
The objective of the proposed workshop on the unstable noise of quantum computing is to address one of the most significant challenges in the development of quantum computing, which is the issue of unstable noise. The workshop aims to bring together experts and researchers from different backgrounds to explore and share their insights on this critical problem. The objective is to provide a platform to discuss different approaches to mitigating noise, including error-correction techniques, noise-reducing algorithms, and hardware improvements.
The detailed objectives are listed as follows:
* Develop a comprehensive understanding of the current state of research on unstable noise in quantum computing.
* Provide a platform for researchers and industry experts to present and discuss their latest findings and insights on mitigating unstable noise in quantum computing.
* Foster collaboration among researchers and industry experts to develop novel techniques and strategies for addressing unstable noise in quantum computing.
* Facilitate discussions on the limitations of current techniques and identify areas where further research is needed.
* Encourage the development of reproducible quantum computing systems that can effectively mitigate unstable noise.
* Provide an opportunity for attendees to network and build new collaborations in the field of quantum computing.

### Abstract

We are currently living in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, where noise and scalability are well-known and crucial issues. We have been witnessing the rapid development of superconducting quantum computers, which gradually alleviates scalability issues where we have quantum computer with 433 qubits from IBM. However, the high noise in quantum computing is still a barrier to the use of quantum computing in real-world applications.
For ibm_belem processor, the qubits error is at the level of 10^-4 to 10^-2.
<!-- Although the ultimate goal is to have a fault-tolerant quantum computer using quantum error correction \cite{reed2012realization}, such a technique relies on a large number of qubits (over thousands of physical qubits for 1 logically noiseless qubit), which is not a near-term solution.
Quantum error mitigation and noise-aware optimization for a dedicated noise are two alternative solutions for near-term quantum computing. -->
Although they have great potential to work well on a fixed noise level, the change of noise will make the pre-designed noise-aware solution useless and incur high overhead for solution adaptation.
Unfortunately, the noises on quantum devices are unstable.
This workshop is proposed to develop an open platform to present the unstable issue to the quantum computing research community, report the state-of-the-art development efforts, exchange ideas and practices, and foster research collaboration to develop novel techniques to address the unstable noise issue and provide a reproducible quantum computing system.
